        title: 'What`s the difference between stress and anxiety?',
        description: `There's a fine line between stress and anxiety. Both are emotional responses, but stress is typically caused by an external trigger. The trigger can be short-term, such as a work deadline or a fight with a loved one or long-term, such as being unable to work, discrimination, or chronic illness. People under stress experience mental and physical symptoms, such as irritability, anger, fatigue, muscle pain, digestive troubles, and difficulty sleeping. Anxiety, on the other hand, is defined by persistent, excessive worries that don't go away even in the absence of a stressor. Anxiety leads to a nearly identical set of symptoms as stress: insomnia, difficulty concentrating, fatigue, muscle tension, and irritability. Both mild stress and mild anxiety respond well to similar coping mechanisms. Physical activity,
         a nutritious and varied diet, and good sleep hygiene are a good starting point, but there are other coping mechanisms available...`,
        fullDescription: `<p>If your stress or anxiety does not respond to these management techniques, or if you feel that either stress or anxiety are affecting your day-to-day functioning or mood, consider talking to a mental health professional who can help you understand what you are experiencing and provide you additional coping tools. For example, a psychologist can help determine whether you may have an anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders differ from short-term feelings of anxiety in their severity and in how long they last: The anxiety typically persists for months and negatively affects mood and functioning. Some anxiety disorders, such as agoraphobia (the fear of public or open spaces), may cause the person to avoid enjoyable activities or make it difficult to keep a job.</p>
        <p> According to the latest data from the National Institute of Mental Health, 31% of Americans will experience an anxiety disorder during their lifetimes.</p>
        <p> One of the most common anxiety disorders is generalized anxiety disorder. To identify if someone has generalized anxiety disorder, a clinician will look for symptoms such as excessive, hard-to-control worry occurring most days over six months. The worry may jump from topic to topic. Generalized anxiety disorder is also accompanied by the physical symptoms of anxiety.</p>
        <p> Another type of anxiety disorder is panic disorder, which is marked by sudden attacks of anxiety that may leave a person sweating, dizzy, and gasping for air. Anxiety may also manifest in the form of specific phobias (such as fear of flying) or as social anxiety, which is marked by a pervasive fear of social situations.</p>
        <p> Anxiety disorders can be treated with psychotherapy, medication, or a combination of the two. One of the most widely used therapeutic approaches is cognitive behavioral therapy, which focuses on changing maladaptive thought patterns related to the anxiety. Another potential treatment is exposure therapy, which involves confronting anxiety triggers in a safe, controlled way in order to break the cycle of fear around the trigger.</p>`,

        title: 'Coping with COVID-19 stress easier with a dose of humor!',
        description: `WASHINGTON — Funny memes may help people cope with the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic, making viewers feel calmer and more content, according to research published by the American Psychological Association. Looking at memes about COVID-19 also increased people's confidence in their ability to deal with the pandemic, according to the study, published in the journal Psychology of Popular Media...`,
        fullDescription: `
        <p>“As the pandemic kept dragging on, it became more and more interesting to me how people were using social media and memes in particular, as a way to think about the pandemic,” said lead author Jessica Gall Myrick, PhD, a professor at Pennsylvania State University. “We found that viewing just three memes can help people cope with the stress of living during a global pandemic.”</p>
        <p>Researchers surveyed 748 people online in December 2020 to determine whether viewing memes would influence their positive emotions, anxiety, information processing and coping surrounding COVID-19. They also sought to determine how memes with different content, subjects and levels of cuteness could affect the participants. Participants ranged from 18 to 88 years old, with an average age of 41.8, and were mostly white (72.2%), female (54.7%) and without a college degree (63.5%).</p>
        <p>The researchers collected hundreds of popular memes from websites like “IMgur” and “IMGflip” and categorized them based on factors such as whether the image featured a human or an animal, if the human or animal was young or old (with young creatures typically judged as cuter) and whether the caption focused on COVID-19 or not. A group of participants reviewed and rated the humor and cuteness of each meme, and the researchers only selected memes for the study that were viewed as equally funny and cute. </p>
        <p>While most of the memes were left unaltered from their source, the researchers wrote some original captions to create similar COVID-related versus non-COVID-related captions for each meme. For example, one meme featured a picture of an angry cat with a COVID-related caption that said, “New study confirms: Cats can't spread COVID-19 but would if given option.”</p>
        <p> The non-COVID-related version of the meme showed the same cat image with the caption, “New study confirms: Cats can't sabotage your car but would if given option.”  
        The researchers first measured how often in the past month participants felt nervous or stressed, among other items. The participants were then randomly assigned to view three memes with the same kind of subject (animal or human), cuteness level (adult or baby) and caption (COVID-related or non-COVID-related) or one of three control conditions featuring plain text without any images. After viewing the media, participants rated how cute and funny they found the meme or control text and reported their levels of anxiety and positive emotions such as calmness, relaxation and cheer. They also rated how much the media caused them to think about other information they knew about COVID-19, their confidence in their ability to cope with the pandemic and their stress about the disease.</p>
       <p> The researchers found that people who viewed memes compared with other types of media reported higher levels of humor and more positive emotions, which was indirectly related to a decrease in stress about the COVID-19 pandemic. People who viewed memes with captions related to COVID-19 were even more likely to have lower stress levels about the pandemic than people who viewed memes without COVID-related captions.</p>
       <p> “While the World Health Organization recommended that people avoid too much COVID-related media for the benefit of their mental health, our research reveals that memes about COVID-19 could help people feel more confident in their ability to deal with the pandemic,” Myrick said. “This suggests that not all media are uniformly bad for mental health and people should stop and take stock of what type of media they are consuming. If we are all more conscious of how our behaviors, including time spent scrolling, affect our emotional states, then we will better be able to use social media to help us when we need it and to take a break from it when </p>
        <p>The researchers also found that people who viewed COVID-related memes thought more deeply about the content they viewed and felt more confident in their ability to cope with the pandemic than people who viewed non-COVID-related captions or any of the control conditions. However, people who viewed cute memes featuring human or animal babies were less likely to think about the pandemic and process how it affected their lives, even when the memes' captions were about COVID-19. </p>
       <p> These findings suggest that social media content about stressful public events can help people process the news without getting overwhelmed by it, according to Myrick.
        “Public health advocates or government agencies could potentially benefit by using memes as a cheap, easily accessible way to communicate about stressful events with the public, though they should avoid overly cute memes,” Myrick said.</p>
        <p> “The positive emotions associated with this type of content may make people feel psychologically safer and therefore better able to pay attention to the underlying messages related to health threats.” </p>`,

        title: 'Types of Depression',
        description: `It's normal to feel down once in a while, but if you're sad most of the time and it affects your daily life, you may have clinical depression. It's a condition you can treat with medicine, talking to a therapist, and changes to your lifestyle.
        There are many different types of depression. Events in your life cause some, and chemical changes in your brain cause others.
        Whatever the cause, your first step is to let your doctor know how you're feeling. They may refer you to a mental health specialist to help figure out the type of depression you have. This diagnosis is important in deciding the right treatment for you...`,
        fullDescription: `<h2>Major Depression</h2>
        <p>You may hear your doctor call this "major depressive disorder." You might have this type if you feel depressed most of the time for most days of the week.  </p>     
        <p>Some other symptoms you might have are:  </p>
        <ul>   
        <li>Loss of interest or pleasure in your activities</li>
        <li> Weight loss or gain </li>
        <li> Trouble getting to sleep or feeling sleepy during the day</li>
        <li>Feeling restless and agitated, or else very sluggish and slowed down physically or mentally</li>
        <li> Being tired and without energy</li>
        <li> Feeling worthless or guilty</li>
        <li> Trouble concentrating or making decisions</li>
        <li> Thoughts of suicide</li>
        </ul>
       <p> Your doctor might diagnose you with major depression if you have five or more of these symptoms on most days for 2 weeks or longer. At least one of the symptoms must be a depressed mood or loss of interest in activities. </p>
        <p>Major depression looks differently in different people. Depending on how your depression makes you feel, it could be:</p>
       <h3> Anxious distress.</h3><p> You feel tense and restless most days. You have trouble concentrating because you're worried that something awful could happen, and you feel like you might lose control of yourself.    </p>
       <h3> Melancholy. </h3><p>You feel intensely sad and lose interest in the activities you used to enjoy. You feel bad even when good things happen. 
       You might also:</p>
       <ul>
       <li> Feel particularly down in the mornings</li>
       <li>Lose weight</li>
       <li> Sleep poorly</li>
       <li> Have suicidal thoughts</li>
       </ul>
       <p> If you have melancholic depression, your symptoms might be worst in the mornings when you first wake up. Consider having someone help you with your first tasks of the day. Make sure to eat regularly even if you don't feel hungry.</p>
        <h3>Agitated.</h3><p> You feel uneasy most of the time. You may also:</p>     
        <ul>
        <li>Talk a lot </li>
        <li>Move for no reason, like fidgeting with your hands and pacing around the room </li>
        <li> Act impulsively </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Talk therapy can help. You'll meet with a mental health specialist who will help you find ways to manage your depression. Medications called antidepressants can also be useful.   
        When therapy and medication aren't working, other options your doctor may suggest are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)</li>
        <li>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)</li>
        <li>Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>ECT uses electrical pulses, TMS uses a special kind of magnet, and VNS uses an implanted device. All are design to stimulate certain areas of brain activity. This helps the parts of your brain that control your mood work better.</p>
       <h2> Persistent Depressive Disorder</h2>
        <p>If you have depression that lasts for 2 years or longer, it's called persistent depressive disorder. This term is used to describe two conditions previously known as dysthymia (low-grade persistent depression) and chronic major depression.</p>
        <p>You may have symptoms such as:</p>
        <ul>
        <li> Change in your appetite (not eating enough or overeating)</li>
        <li> Sleeping too much or too little</li>
        <li> Lack of energy, or fatigue</li>
        <li> Low self-esteem</li>
        <li> Trouble concentrating or making decisions</li>
        <li>Feeling hopeless</li>
        <p>You may be treated with psychotherapy, medication, or a combination of the two.</p>
      <h2>  Bipolar Disorder</h2>
       <p> Someone with bipolar disorder, which is also sometimes called "manic depression," has mood episodes that range from extremes of high energy with an "up" mood to low "depressive" periods.</p>
        <p>When you're in the low phase, you'll have the symptoms of major depression.</p>
       <p> Medication can help bring your mood swings under control. Whether you're in a high or a low period, your doctor may suggest a mood stabilizer, such as lithium.</p>
       <p> The FDA has approved three medicines to treat the depressed phase:</p>
       <ul>
       <li>Seroquel</li>
       <li> Latuda</li>
       <li>Olanzapine-fluoxetine combination</li>
       </ul>
       <p> Doctors sometimes prescribe other drugs "off label" for bipolar depression, such as the anticonvulsant lamotrigine or the atypical antipsychotic Vraylar.</p>
        <p>Traditional antidepressants are not always recommended as first-line treatments for bipolar depression because there's no proof from studies that these drugs are more helpful than a placebo (a sugar pill) in treating depression in people with bipolar disorder. Also, for a small percentage of people with bipolar disorder, some traditional antidepressants may increase the risk of causing a "high" phase of illness, or speeding up the frequency of having more episodes over time.  </p>
       <p> Psychotherapy can also help support you and your family. </p>
       <h2> Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)</h2>
       <p> Seasonal affective disorder is a period of major depression that most often happens during the winter months, when the days grow short and you get less and less sunlight. It typically goes away in the spring and summer. 
        If you have SAD, antidepressants can help. So can light therapy. You'll need to sit in front of a special bright light box for about 15-30 minutes each day.</p>
       <h2> Psychotic Depression</h2>
       <p> People with psychotic depression have the symptoms of major depression along with "psychotic" symptoms, such as:</p>
       <ul>
       <li>Hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there)</li>
       <li>Delusions (false beliefs)</li>
       <li>Paranoia (wrongly believing that others are trying to harm you)</li>
       </ul>
       <p> A combination of antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs can treat psychotic depression. ECT may also be an option.</p>
       <h2> Peripartum (Postpartum) Depression</h2>
       <p> Women who have major depression in the weeks and months after childbirth may have peripartum depression. Approximately 1 in 10 men also experience depression in the peripartum period. Antidepressant drugs can help similarly to treating major depression that is unrelated to childbirth.  </p>
       <h2> Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD)</h2>
       <p> Women with PMDD have depression and other symptoms at the start of their period. </p>
       <p> Besides feeling depressed, you may also have: </p>
       <ul>
       <li> Mood swings</li>
       <li>Irritability</li>
       <li>Anxiety</li>
       <li>Trouble concentrating</li>
       <li> Fatigue</li>
       <li>Change in appetite or sleep habits</li>
       <li>Feelings of being overwhelmed</li>
       <li> Antidepressant medication or sometimes oral contraceptives can treat PMDD</li>
        </ul>
       <h2> 'Situational' Depression</h2>
        <p>This isn't a technical term in psychiatry. But you can have a depressed mood when you're having trouble managing a stressful event in your life, such as a death in your family, a divorce, or losing your job. Your doctor may call this "stress response syndrome."</p>
       <p> Psychotherapy can often help you get through a period of depression that's related to a stressful situation. </p>
        <h2>Atypical Depression</h2>
        <p>This type is different from the persistent sadness of typical depression. It is considered to be a "specifier" that describes a pattern of depressive symptoms. If you have atypical depression, a positive event can temporarily improve your mood.
        Other symptoms of atypical depression include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li> Increased appetite</li>
        <li> Sleeping more than usual</li>
        <li>Feeling of heaviness in your arms and legs</li>
        <li>Oversensitive to criticism</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Antidepressants can help. Your doctor may suggest a type called an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) as the first-line treatment.
        They may also sometimes recommend an older type of antidepressant called an MAOI (monoamine oxidase inhibitor), which is a class of antidepressants that has been well-studied in treating atypical depression.</p>
       <h2> Treatment Resistant Depression</h2>
       <p> About 1/3 of people treated for depression try several treatment methods without success. If that's you, you might have treatment resistant depression. There are many reasons your depression might be treatment resistant. For example, you might have other conditions that make your depression difficult to treat. 
        If you're diagnosed with treatment resistant depression, your doctor might recommend some less conventional treatment options. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is sometimes helpful in this situation.</p>`,

        title: 'Coping with stress at work',
        description: 'Everyone who has ever held a job has, at some point, felt the pressure of work-related stress. Any job can have stressful elements, even if you love what you do. In the short-term, you may experience pressure to meet a deadline or to fulfill a challenging obligation. But when work stress becomes chronic, it can be overwhelming—and harmful to both physical and emotional health...',
        fullDescription: `
        <p>Unfortunately, such long-term stress is all too common. In fact, APA's annual Stress in America survey has consistently found that work is cited as a significant source of stress by a majority of Americans. You can't always avoid the tensions that occur on the job. Yet you can take steps to manage work-related stress.</p>
        <h2>Common sources of work stress</h2>
        <p>Certain factors tend to go hand-in-hand with work-related stress. Some common workplace stressors are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Low salaries</li>
        <li>Excessive workloadsFew opportunities for growth or advancement</li>
        <li>Work that isn't engaging or challengingLack of social support</li>
        <li>Not having enough control over job-related decisions</li>
        <li>Conflicting demands or unclear performance expectations</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Effects of uncontrolled stress</h2>
        <p>Work-related stress doesn't just disappear when you head home for the day. When stress persists, it can take a toll on your health and well-being. 
        A stressful work environment can contribute to problems such as headache, stomachache, sleep disturbances, short temper, and difficulty concentrating. Chronic stress can result in anxiety, insomnia, high blood pressure, and a weakened immune system. It can also contribute to health conditions such as depression,
         obesity, and heart disease. Compounding the problem, people who experience excessive stress often deal with it in unhealthy ways, such as overeating, eating unhealthy foods, smoking cigarettes, or abusing drugs and alcohol.</p>
        <h2>Taking steps to manage stress</h2>
        <p>Track your stressors. Keep a journal for a week or two to identify which situations create the most stress and how you respond to them. Record your thoughts, feelings, and information about the environment, including the people and circumstances involved, the physical setting, and how you reacted. 
        Did you raise your voice? Get a snack from the vending machine? Go for a walk? Taking notes can help you find patterns among your stressors and your reactions to them.Develop healthy responses. Instead of attempting to fight stress with fast food or alcohol, do your best to make healthy choices when you feel the tension rise.
         Exercise is a great stress-buster. Yoga can be an excellent choice, but any form of physical activity is beneficial. Also make time for hobbies and favorite activities. Whether it's reading a novel, going to concerts, or playing games with your family, make sure to set aside time for the things that bring you pleasure.
        Getting enough good-quality sleep is also important for effective stress management. Build healthy sleep habits by limiting your caffeine intake late in the day and minimizing stimulating activities, such as computer and television use, at night.Establish boundaries. In today's digital world, it's easy to feel pressure to be available 24 hours a day.
        Establish some work-life boundaries for yourself. That might mean making a rule not to check email from home in the evening, or not answering the phone during dinner. Although people have different preferences when it comes to how much they blend their work and home life, creating some clear boundaries between these realms can reduce the potential
        for work-life conflict and the stress that goes with it.Take time to recharge. To avoid the negative effects of chronic stress and burnout, we need time to replenish and return to our pre-stress level of functioning. This recovery process requires “switching off” from work by having periods of time when you are neither engaging in work-related activities,
         nor thinking about work. That's why it's critical that you disconnect from time to time, in a way that fits your needs and preferences. Don't let your vacation days go to waste. When possible, take time off to relax and unwind, so you come back to work feeling reinvigorated and ready to perform at your best. When you're not able to take time off, get a quick 
         boost by turning off your smartphone and focusing your attention on nonwork activities for a while.Learn how to relax. Techniques such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, and mindfulness (a state in which you actively observe present experiences and thoughts without judging them) can help melt away stress. Start by taking a few minutes each day to focus
        on a simple activity like breathing, walking, or enjoying a meal. The skill of being able to focus purposefully on a single activity without distraction will get stronger with practice and you'll find that you can apply it to many different aspects of your life.Talk to your supervisor. Employee health has been linked to productivity at work, so your boss has
        an incentive to create a work environment that promotes employee well-being. Start by having an open conversation with your supervisor. The purpose of this isn't to lay out a list of complaints, but rather to come up with an effective plan for managing the stressors you've identified, so you can perform at your best on the job. While some parts of the plan may
        be designed to help you improve your skills in areas such as time management, other elements might include identifying employer-sponsored wellness resources you can tap into, clarifying what's expected of you, getting necessary resources or support from colleagues, enriching your job to include more challenging or meaningful tasks, or making changes to your physical 
        workspace to make it more comfortable and reduce strain.Get some support. Accepting help from trusted friends and family members can improve your ability to manage stress. Your employer may also have stress management resources available through an employee assistance program, including online information, available counseling, and referral to mental health professionals,
        if needed. If you continue to feel overwhelmed by work stress, you may want to talk to a psychologist, who can help you better manage stress and change unhealthy behavior.</p>`,
